# Email Templates & Form Submission Feature Guide

## Overview
This guide explains the enhanced email template system and the new form submission feature that allows recipients to respond to emails via embedded forms.

## üìß Email Template Improvements

### HTML Email Structure
All emails generated from the visual editor are now wrapped in a proper email-compatible HTML structure:
- Uses table-based layout for maximum email client compatibility
- Includes responsive design with max-width of 600px
- Proper DOCTYPE and meta tags for rendering
- Inline CSS for all styling (required for email clients)

### Image Handling
Images in email templates are now handled correctly:
- **Proper Image URLs**: Images must use publicly accessible URLs (not local file paths)
- **Max Width**: Images are automatically constrained to 600px max-width for email compatibility
- **Fallback**: Uses placeholder images by default if no source is provided
- **Responsive**: Images scale properly on mobile devices

**How to use images:**
1. Drag the "Image" component to your template
2. In the properties panel, enter a publicly accessible image URL (e.g., from your website, CDN, or image hosting service)
3. The image will display correctly in sent emails

**Example URLs:**
- `https://example.com/images/logo.png`
- `https://cdn.example.com/banner.jpg`
- `https://via.placeholder.com/600x400` (placeholder service)

### Video Handling
Since most email clients don't support embedded videos, videos are rendered as clickable poster images:
- **Poster Image**: Shows a thumbnail with a play button overlay
- **Click to Watch**: Links to the video URL
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works in all email clients
- **Professional Look**: Styled with a play button overlay

**How to use videos:**
1. Drag the "Video" component to your template
2. Set the video URL (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, or your hosted video)
3. Set a poster image URL (the thumbnail that recipients will see)
4. Recipients click the image to open and watch the video

## üìã Form Submission Feature

### Overview
Recipients can now fill out and submit forms directly from emails you send them. All responses are stored in the database and can be viewed in the application.

### How It Works

#### 1. Creating a Form in Your Email
1. Open the Visual Editor when creating a custom template
2. Drag the "Contact Form" component onto your canvas
3. Customize the form:
   - **Title**: Set a title for your form
   - **Fields**: Choose which fields to include (Name, Email, Phone, Message, etc.)
   - **Button Text**: Customize the submit button text
4. Save your template

#### 2. Form Submission by Recipients
When a recipient receives your email:
1. They fill out the form fields directly in their email
2. Click the submit button
3. The form data is sent securely to your backend server
4. They see a beautiful "Thank You" confirmation page
5. Their submission is stored in your database

#### 3. Viewing Form Responses
To view submissions:
1. Click "Form Responses" in the sidebar
2. See a list of all submissions with:
   - Submitter name/email (if provided)
   - Submission date and time
   - Preview of form data
3. Click any submission to view full details:
   - All form fields and responses
   - Submission metadata (IP address, user agent)
   - Timestamp information

### Backend API Endpoints

#### POST `/api/form-submission`
Handles form submissions from email recipients.

**Request Format**: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (standard HTML form)

**Request Body:**
- `formId`: Unique identifier for the form
- Additional fields depend on the form configuration (name, email, message, etc.)

**Response**: HTML page with success/error message

**Database Storage:**
```javascript
{
  formId: String,           // Unique form identifier
  submittedAt: Date,       // Submission timestamp
  data: Object,            // All form field data
  submitterEmail: String,  // Extracted from form
  submitterName: String,   // Extracted from form
  ipAddress: String,       // Submitter's IP
  userAgent: String        // Browser information
}
```

#### GET `/api/form-submissions`
Retrieves all form submissions or filter by formId.

**Query Parameters:**
- `formId` (optional): Filter submissions by specific form

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "submissions": [...],
  "count": 5
}
```

### Form Fields
The Contact Form component supports various field types:
- **Name**: Text input for names
- **Email**: Email validation
- **Phone**: Text input for phone numbers
- **Message**: Multi-line textarea for messages
- **Custom fields**: Can be added in the component

### Security Features

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Images
- ‚úÖ Use publicly hosted images (not local files)
- ‚úÖ Use appropriate image sizes (600px width recommended)
- ‚úÖ Test images in different email clients
- ‚ùå Don't use base64 images (they increase email size significantly)
- ‚ùå Don't use animated GIFs (limited support)

### Forms
- ‚úÖ Keep forms short (3-5 fields ideal)
- ‚úÖ Mark important fields as required
- ‚úÖ Use clear field labels
- ‚úÖ Test form submission before sending to recipients
- ‚ùå Don't ask for sensitive information (passwords, SSN, etc.)
- ‚ùå Don't use complex validation (email clients have limitations)

### Templates
- ‚úÖ Test templates by sending to yourself first
- ‚úÖ Use responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- ‚úÖ Keep email width at 600px maximum
- ‚úÖ Use web-safe fonts (Arial, Helvetica, etc.)
- ‚ùå Don't use JavaScript (not supported in emails)
- ‚ùå Don't use external CSS files (use inline styles only)

### Videos
- ‚úÖ Use high-quality poster images
- ‚úÖ Host videos on reliable platforms (YouTube, Vimeo)
- ‚úÖ Include a call-to-action ("Click to watch")
- ‚ùå Don't try to embed actual video players (not supported)

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Node.js & Express
- MongoDB (for storing submissions)
- Nodemailer (for sending emails)
- Environment variables configured (EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS)

### Frontend
- React
- React DnD (for drag-and-drop)
- Tailwind CSS

### Email Server
- SMTP access (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
- App passwords configured (for Gmail)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing
- **Check URL**: Ensure the image URL is publicly accessible
- **Test URL**: Open the image URL in a browser
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS URLs when possible
- **CDN**: Consider using a CDN for better delivery

### Forms Not Working
- **Backend Running**: Make sure backend server is running on port 5000
- **MongoDB**: Verify MongoDB connection
- **Network**: Check if recipient can reach your backend
- **CORS**: Ensure CORS is enabled for form submissions

### Template Not Saving
- **LocalStorage**: Check if browser localStorage is enabled
- **Space**: Ensure sufficient localStorage space
- **Console**: Check browser console for errors

### Responses Not Appearing
- **Refresh**: Click the refresh button in Form Responses view
- **Database**: Verify MongoDB is connected
- **Backend Logs**: Check backend console for errors

## üìä Database Schema

### FormSubmission Model
```javascript
{
  formId: String,           // Required - links to form in email
  submittedAt: Date,       // Auto-generated timestamp
  data: Mixed,             // Flexible - stores all form fields
  submitterEmail: String,  // Extracted from 'email' field
  submitterName: String,   // Extracted from 'name' field
  ipAddress: String,       // Submitter's IP address
  userAgent: String        // Browser/client information
}
```

### Indexes
- `formId`: For filtering submissions by form
- `submittedAt`: For chronological sorting

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Client Proposals
Create a proposal email with a contact form for client feedback:
- Include project details
- Add images/mockups
- Embed feedback form
- Track responses

### 2. Event Invitations
Send event invites with RSVP form:
- Event details and images
- RSVP form with dietary preferences
- Track attendees

### 3. Product Launches
Announce new products with interest form:
- Product images and videos
- Feature highlights
- Early access signup form

### 4. Customer Surveys
Gather feedback via email forms:

- Open-ended questions
- Quick response collection

### 5. Lead Generation
Marketing emails with lead capture:

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: Form submissions contain personal information
2. **Storage**: All data is stored in MongoDB
3. **Access Control**: Only you can view submissions (via your app)
4. **IP Logging**: IPs are logged for security/spam prevention
5. **No Authentication**: Recipients don't need to log in to submit

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
