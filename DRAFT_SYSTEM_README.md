# Email Draft System

## Overview
Your email system now has a comprehensive draft system that automatically saves emails as drafts before they are sent. Every email goes through a draft state first, ensuring no work is lost.

## Features

### üöÄ Automatic Draft Creation
- **Auto-save on typing**: Drafts are automatically saved 2 seconds after you stop typing
- **Periodic auto-save**: Drafts are saved every 10 seconds while composing
- **Save on close**: Drafts are automatically saved when you close the compose modal

### üìù Draft Management
- **View all drafts**: Access drafts from the sidebar
- **Edit drafts**: Click on any draft to continue editing
- **Delete drafts**: Remove unwanted drafts with the delete button
- **Draft indicators**: Visual indicators show when drafts are being saved

### üìß Email Sending Flow
1. **Start composing**: Create a new email or edit an existing draft
2. **Auto-save**: System automatically saves your progress as a draft
3. **Send email**: When you click send, the email is sent and the draft is automatically deleted
4. **Sent emails**: Successfully sent emails appear in the "Sent" folder

## How It Works

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **MongoDB Storage**: Drafts are stored in MongoDB with fallback to in-memory storage
- **REST API**: Complete CRUD operations for drafts
- **Auto-cleanup**: Drafts are automatically deleted when emails are sent

### Frontend (React)
- **Real-time saving**: Debounced auto-save prevents data loss
- **Visual feedback**: Status indicators show save progress
- **Draft browser**: Easy access to all saved drafts
- **Seamless editing**: Continue where you left off

## API Endpoints

### Draft Management
- `GET /api/drafts` - Fetch all drafts
- `POST /api/drafts` - Create new draft
- `PUT /api/drafts/:id` - Update existing draft
- `DELETE /api/drafts/:id` - Delete draft
- `GET /api/drafts/:id` - Get specific draft

### Email Sending
- `POST /api/send-email` - Send email (automatically deletes draft if sent from draft)

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Draft
```javascript
// Automatically happens when you start typing
const draft = {
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Email Subject',
  message: 'Email content...',
  messageHtml: '<p>Email content...</p>'
};
```

### Sending from Draft
```javascript
// When sending an email from a draft, include the draftId
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('draftId', currentDraft._id);
// ... other email data
```

## Configuration

### Auto-save Settings
- **Typing delay**: 2 seconds after user stops typing
- **Periodic save**: Every 10 seconds
- **Save on close**: Always saves before closing

### Storage Options
1. **MongoDB** (Primary): Persistent storage with full CRUD operations
2. **In-memory** (Fallback): Temporary storage when MongoDB is unavailable

## Benefits

### For Users
- ‚úÖ **Never lose work**: All emails are automatically saved as drafts
- ‚úÖ **Resume anytime**: Continue editing drafts later
- ‚úÖ **Visual feedback**: Know when your work is being saved
- ‚úÖ **Clean interface**: Drafts are automatically cleaned up after sending

### For Developers
- ‚úÖ **Robust storage**: MongoDB with in-memory fallback
- ‚úÖ **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP methods for all operations
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error recovery
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Easy to extend with additional features

## Testing

Run the draft system test:
```bash
cd backend
node test-draft-system.js
```

This will test:
- Creating drafts
- Fetching drafts
- Updating drafts
- Deleting drafts
- Error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Draft templates**: Save common email templates
- **Draft sharing**: Share drafts with team members
- **Draft scheduling**: Schedule drafts to be sent later
- **Draft analytics**: Track draft completion rates
- **Bulk operations**: Select and manage multiple drafts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Drafts not saving**: Check MongoDB connection
2. **Auto-save not working**: Verify frontend-backend connection
3. **Drafts not deleting**: Check email sending process

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` in your environment variables.

**Note**: This draft system ensures that every email goes through a draft state before being sent, providing a safety net for users and preventing data loss.
